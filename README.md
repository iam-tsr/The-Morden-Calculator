# The Morden Calculator

This project implements a simple command-line interface for a morden calculator (Automated calculation Machine) system. It allows users to solve Calculations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Factorial, and Number Power.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**
   - Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the code. For example, using GCC:
     ```
     gcc ModernCalculator.c.c -o ModernCalculator
     ```
2. **Run the Program**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```
     ./ModernCalculator
     ```
3. **Options**
   - Once the program starts, you'll be presented with the following options:
     - 1: Addition(+)
     - 2: Subtration(-)
     - 3: Multiplication(*)
     - 4: Division(/)
     - 5: Power(^)
     - 6: Factorial(!)
4. **Enter Input**
   - Input integer value only.
4. **Perform Calculation**
   - Select an option by entering the corresponding number and follow the prompts.
## Code Overview
The code defines various functions for versatile console application with advanced mathematical functions, memory features, and a user-friendly interface for efficient calculations.
### Note
- The code assumes that the user interacts with the program through a console or terminal.
